# Hello_world 👋
## My name is Awum Fredy, an upcoming Software Engineer.

##  Am from Cameroon and i study in YIBS university.
 
## Educational Journey 🛩️
### My journey as a first-year software engineering student has been a mix of excitement, challenges, and growth. When I first started, everything felt completely new. Writing my first lines of code and trying to understand concepts like algorithms, data  
### structures, and object-oriented programming was exciting but also intimidating. At times, I felt overwhelmed, especially when assignments piled up or when my code refused to run no matter how many times I debugged it.
### Looking back, my first year has been challenging, demanding, and at the same time, incredibly rewarding. It laid the foundation for the software engineer I am becoming.

# Personal Experience 📚

## As a beginner, I am gaining experience through classwork, assignments, and small projects.
## I have learned basic computer operations, simple programming concepts, and how to use tools like Microsoft Word and GitHub. These experiences are helping me grow academically and professionally.

# Project 💼 

## One of my projects is a simple student/hostel management application (or any beginner project you have done).
## The project helps to store and manage basic information such as names and records. This project helped me understand problem-solving and basic system design.
