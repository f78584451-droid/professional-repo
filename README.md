##  Am from Cameroon and i study in YIBS university.
 
## Educational Journey 🛩️
### My journey as a first-year software engineering student has been a mix of excitement, challenges, and growth. When I first started, everything felt completely new. Writing my first lines of code and trying to understand concepts like algorithms, data  
### structures, and object-oriented programming was exciting but also intimidating. At times, I felt overwhelmed, especially when assignments piled up or when my code refused to run no matter how many times I debugged it.
### Looking back, my first year has been challenging, demanding, and at the same time, incredibly rewarding. It laid the foundation for the software engineer I am becoming.
